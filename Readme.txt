Hi Mr. Wasserman,

This is a website I made that has many AP Resources for AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP Statistics, AP Calculus AB/BC, and AP Computer Science A. This website was mostly for me to learn more cool tricks and the fundamentals of HTML/CSS website design,
but I also believe that this website has some good resources that greatly helped me when I was studying 
(EX: videos and documents).

In the past, I have worked on the Key Club website with Weebly and played around with some HTML and CSS in Robotics, but I never had a solid understanding of the foundations of HTML/CSS and the cool features that connect them. 
Especially because I want to improve the robotics website next year which is edited through GitHub, for this final project I decided to learn the ins-and-outs of HTML and CSS and then build a website completely from scratch using Notepad++.
In this project, I learned from websites like W3Schools and various youtube tutorials. And through this project, I learned how to code things like tables, images, links, fancy text styles, moving text and moving images, embed videos, create buttons and design them, make a footer, organize a website properly and cleanly, and make a navigation bar.  

In particular, coding the website slider was the most difficult because I had to browse through many youtube "tutorials" but most of them did not work. It took me over 3 hours until I finally was able to create a working slider and find proper background images for them. 

*MOST IMPORTANT DETAIL* - In order to be able to view the code, the most important thing is to have the software "Notepad++" downloaded on your computer. Then, on Notepad++ you can open up the .html and .css files! Please email me if you have any difficulties with viewing the code :D. 

GUIDE TO CODE:

index.html is the home page. The other files(biology.html, chemistry.html, statistics.html, calculus.html, compsci.html) are the webpages for the 5 subjects I included, respectively. 
stylesheet.css is the CSS page that determines behavior of text and details in each of the HTML pages. And secret.html is an html page that is linked to when the feedback form is filled out. 
The "Images" folder has all the images that I used in the website, and "5video" is the video that is embeded in the home page. 

But some specific features: 
- Table with links to past AP tests (EX: on AP Calculus Webpage)
- Buttons and its special effects (EX: arrow animation when you hover over it)
- Slider
- Moving text and image
- Fonts and other CSS styles
- Footer
- Navigation Menu
- Specfic images and formatting them to be next to each other and take up similar space
- All the specific links to college board websites and other helpful notes
- Other CSS Features


Hope you enjoy, and thank you for being such an amazing teacher!
